/*:
 ## Exercise - Variables
 
 Declare a variable `schooling` and set it to the number of years of school that you have completed. Print `schooling` to the console.
 */
var school = 15
print(school)


/*:
 Now imagine you just completed an additional year of school, and update the `schooling` variable accordingly. Print `schooling` to the console.
 */
school = 16
print("Updated years of school: \(school)")



/*:
 Does the above code compile? Why is this different than trying to update a constant? Print your explanation to the console using the `print` function.
 */
// It lets itself compile as we are working with variables, instead of constants
